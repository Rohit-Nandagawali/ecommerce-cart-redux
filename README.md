## Project Overview

The ecommerce website built with React and Redux enables users to browse through a collection of products fetched using the FakeStore API. Users can add items to their cart, view the total cost, and easily remove items from the cart. Additionally, users can create a wishlist, add items to it, and remove items from the wishlist. The user interface might not be fully polished as the primary focus was on learning Redux concepts.
